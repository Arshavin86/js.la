As a complement, the language offers viable means of conducting test-driven development (TDD). Some of the technologies covered in this talk will be: Express, SuperAgent, Mocha, and Chai. Tommy will explain TDD basics from a Node perspective, transitioning into real examples of clever ways to prove that a web app works as advertised. The result is a surge in programmer confidence and a foundation to ensure long-term software quality!",
