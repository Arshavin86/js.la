      All games in any language start with the same basic structure. A timer updates various elements and renders them on the screen. This talk walks through the basics of making a simple game in JavaScript. We start with a game loop and progresses adding a new feature at each step along the way. The end result has graphics, physics, sprite animation, collision detection, text and sound.
