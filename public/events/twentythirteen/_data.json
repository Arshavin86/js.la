Rather than running for the hills with screams of \"making databases can't be for me\" let's gear up with some node modules and talk about how we can solve data woes. You can use the level module for great success, but you will find that Leveldb and node together have all of the primitives required to create any database. it's fast and fun. lets have an adventure!",

For most people, the latter would reek of assumption dependent frameworks, but we'll discover how to apply some primitive philosophies to escape from that pain and keep full control instead. Yes, you can have your cake and eat it too, with elegant and maintainable code - you'll laugh, you'll cry, we'll kill Socrates, and we'll cook a Kraken. Just don't bring popcorn, or it might burst the kernel into panic.",
