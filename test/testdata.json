Don’t get me wrong I love all the aforementioned libraries like a father loves his children, but when it is time to get practical and create performance solutions those babies got to go. I’m going to introduce you to an old friend of mine, the JavaScript native image object. This ol’boy is perhaps one of the most powerful objects in JavaScript and he’s uber simple to get to know. I’m going to show you some of his tricks and try to convince you that he belongs in your JavaScript solutions tool belt!",

No, there’s no new language to learn. Just familiar old HTML and JavaScript. As a matter of fact, there’s some stuff for you to un-learn. AngularJS is a client-side JavaScript web development framework where we believe we’ve done something special. We’ve approached the problem let’s say differently from the way any other JavaScript tool has before. Instead of asking what kind of functions we could provide to make writing apps smoother, we asked \"what if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?\" This talk will take the audience on a tour of what the web platform of the future will look like and how the AngularJS framework can provide many of the powerful capabilities to existing browsers and bridge the path to web components, model driven views and other platform features that are currently being spec-ed.",

With WebGL it was different - my first contact with this technology was through a client project. I had to learn WebGL on the go. It took me a few months to actually start apperciating it, but once the project was over and I thought I know everything about it, I decided to write my own engine that I baptized simply J3D. After a good start, I realized I didn't know that much about WebGL after all... Since then I spent many day & nights (mostly nights) learning and creating what I believe is a good tool for other developers to start creating 3D applications in the browser. In my presentation I talk about specific challenges when working WebGL projects and how J3D addresses them. I will also take you on a short walk-through of it's features and present some demos.",

      "description": "React is created for building large web applications with data that changes in response to actions over time. This is exactly what many of our user-facing products are doing. Yet like many other application frameworks, scalability and maintainability are not inherent, because you are still free to organize your application as long as you follow the unidirectional flow. This talk will share lessons learned from my React application development with code samples at different stages of the unidirectional flow with the goal to truly take advantage of React to build a scalable and maintainable application.",

The interface is a simple webpage served by the Galileo. Using a Google Blockly graphical interface, kids connect nodes representing graphical elements to nodes representing switches and sliders connected to the Galileo. And just like that… art.",

Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1.

But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load.

While we have good and proven solutions it's not uncommon to still see these vulnerabilities in modern and legacy applications in use today. Typically this is due to the solutions not being utilized by the engineers, the application's framework not having support, or the engineers subverting the functionality to work around issues in the application. We'll take a deep dive into just how CSRF works followed by why the vulnerability class exists, and finally end demonstrating a solution that can be injected into any JavaScript frontend application to add support to existing applications.",

      "description": "At Carbon Five, we think reactive programming is a great way to build frontend GUI applications. We use ReactiveX, which has amazingly robust libraries across a variety of languages. We've found the concepts translate well across of a variety of client projects, platforms, and frameworks, so much so that it's almost our de facto standard way to build frontends.\n\nWe also work on React projects that use Redux. Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1. A general introduction to functional reactive programming.\n2. An introduction to ReactiveX libraries\n3. A broad comparison between ReactiveX and Redux\n",

Thrift was off the table again. From spite I asked myself, \"Why not write another IDL?\"\n\nOver the months, I iterated between imaginary specs and prototype code. I developed a general direction for where this fetal IDL will go.\n \nI quit my job. Unrelated. The opportunity now shown itself to go head first into the IDL. Another project would serve as a driving force for design.\n\nJumping back and forth between the projects formed a symbotic relationship between them.\nHaving a practical project, the IDL's \"killer app\", exposed many devilish details with the IDL. The countless tweaks left it with a more practical flavor.\nOf course, having a project actually use the IDL is motivating in itself. I have a glimpse into the flexibility and ease for next-gen APIs. Well, at least for my APIs.\n\nI want to share more than some unique technical aspects of the IDL but also the process and consequential advantages of developing projects symbotically.\n\nIDL: https://www.colorless-idl.org\nOther Project: https://www.camp47.com",

I totally understand if it's not a good fit for js.la, though!\n\nDescription: \nThose of us who have worked in software development for longer than a few years probably feel we have an intuitive sense of what a great developer is. Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work.\n\nThe slide deck I used at PyCon:  \nhttp://bit.ly/pycon-empathy-talk\n\nVideo from PyCon 2018:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYWlfVqBQLc\n\n",

While we have good and proven solutions it's not uncommon to still see these vulnerabilities in modern and legacy applications in use today. Typically this is due to the solutions not being utilized by the engineers, the application's framework not having support, or the engineers subverting the functionality to work around issues in the application. We'll take a deep dive into just how CSRF works followed by why the vulnerability class exists, and finally end demonstrating a solution that can be injected into any JavaScript frontend application to add support to existing applications.",

Even though that was only one page, it was a checkout page, so there were a lot of things going on there: a lot of API calls to verify the data, need to decrypt the params that were passed there, additionally would need to encrypt the response as well. \nFirst thought was - to build an server app that would return simple HTML/CSS and may have some vanila JS. But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load. And the final decision was to have AWS lambda render a page for us. \nSo the talk would be about SSR of React app in cloud functions (particularly aws lambda).",

I'd like to showcase this module along with the options available to us today when it comes to creating music with JavaScript in the browser and Node.js right from the terminal. Using my module and regular JavaScript String and Array functions I will put together the basic structure of an Electronic Dance Music track and show how easy it is for you to start dabbling with EDM using JavaScript.\n\nRequirements\n\nSince this talk is primarily around dance music with JS, a good sound is required (If the venue is not too big, I can get my own sound)\nI will be live coding - I will compose parts of a EDM track with JavaScript and Node.js\n\nPast talks where I presented this topic with variations:\n* JS @ PayPal\n* SF Node @ GitHub HQ\n* ForwardJS\n\nIf you d like to get an idea of the kind of talk it would be, you can take a look at this publicly available video of my talk at Github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIiwFzFvsmw\n\nI hope you ll consider my talk worthy of your meetup. Nat Lubeck is the one who told me about this wonderful meetup when I moved to LA earlier this year. Looking forward to speaking at JS.la,\n\nSincerely!",

I love the Open Source community in general, and the JavaScript community in general, and have been involved in the communities we lived before in Boston, Zurich and Berlin. I would love to get more involved in LA, as we will stay for a few years at least.\n\nMy recent talks were on \"Welcoming Communities\" [1] at EmpireJS and Cascadia.js. I was part of the community panel at last year’s GitHub universe [2]. I talked on small modules (semantic-release & Greenkeeper) at Boston.js, and noBackend at Front-Trends [3]. I gave my first talk on Offline First at Brazil JS in 2014.\n\nI’m one of the founding contributors to Hoodie (hood.ie) – an Open Source Backend for web applications. It stores data on the client by default and syncs whenever the connectivity allows, hence we started offlinefirst.org back in 2013. I co-organized the first \"Offline Camps\" [4] last year, I’ll be on a panel at SXSW and we will host a track at a conference toward the end of this year.\n",
