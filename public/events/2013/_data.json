The recent browserify v2 rewrite embraces streaming APIs, lots of tiny modules all doing exactly one thing well, and timeless unix wisdom. Now you can bundle static assets with source transforms, generate compact bundles with standalone streaming pipeline tools, trivially test your modules in node and against every browser ever and other superpowers all with a new very tiny bundle filesize overhead that supports multiple bundles. Finally the sublime wisdom of node and unix can be realized all the way up the stack in browsers too.",
