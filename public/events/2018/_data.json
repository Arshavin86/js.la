We use ReactiveX, which has amazingly robust libraries across a variety of languages. We've found the concepts translate well across of a variety of client projects, platforms, and frameworks, so much so that it's almost our de facto standard way to build frontends.\n\nWe also work on React projects that use Redux. Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1. A general introduction to functional reactive programming.\n2. An introduction to ReactiveX libraries\n3. A broad comparison between ReactiveX and Redux\n",

Even though that was only one page, it was a checkout page, so there were a lot of things going on there: a lot of API calls to verify the data, need to decrypt the params that were passed there, additionally would need to encrypt the response as well. \nFirst thought was - to build an server app that would return simple HTML/CSS and may have some vanila JS. But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load. And the final decision was to have AWS lambda render a page for us. \nSo the talk would be about SSR of React app in cloud functions (particularly aws lambda).",

While we have good and proven solutions it's not uncommon to still see these vulnerabilities in modern and legacy applications in use today. Typically this is due to the solutions not being utilized by the engineers, the application's framework not having support, or the engineers subverting the functionality to work around issues in the application. We'll take a deep dive into just how CSRF works followed by why the vulnerability class exists, and finally end demonstrating a solution that can be injected into any JavaScript frontend application to add support to existing applications.",
