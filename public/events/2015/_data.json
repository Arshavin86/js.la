In fact, JavaScript has had almost everything you need to program in a purely functional style from the beginning. In this talk, we'll explore the basics of functional programming - higher-order functions, lazy evaluation and immutable persistent data structures. We'll see how a functional style helps you compose logic in a way that's clean, testable and free of certain classes of bugs. Then we'll tie it together into a purely functional style by demonstrating a clever algorithmic game solver.",

This talk will share lessons learned from my React application development with code samples at different stages of the unidirectional flow with the goal to truly take advantage of React to build a scalable and maintainable application.",
