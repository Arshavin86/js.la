A name so dull and generic may surprise you if you're used to hipster naming conventions, and could cover everything from generating GIFs (hard G for life) to the prepackaged icons you can find in Twitter Bootstrap. But immense power lurks behind this bland name. WebGL lets you put GPU graphics in a <canvas> element, and it powers terrific games, infographics, and demoscene-style visuals. Giles Bowkett will blunder through this library, attempting to make it do things, and tell you all about it.",
